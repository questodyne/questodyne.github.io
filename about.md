Welcome to Sol Heavy Industries.
My aim here is to share what I enjoy, mainly tinkering with Linux, paying video games, learning some new stuff and most of all, sharing it with people.

This is my first run at a github page and learning how to use it is a fun process. I’m trying to publish some blog news about new stuff I discover and that might interest or help people. Time to time I upload a video of me playing some games, mainly on Linux, just for the fun of showing that gaming on this OS is a reality.

I hope that you read some interesting thing here and that on the way you learn something.
Feel free to share a few word with me on twitter if you like. I’ll be sure to respond.

Enjoy.
