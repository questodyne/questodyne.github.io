<p>The Nintendo Switch was released just a little bit than 3 years ago on March 2017. At the end of March 2020, Nintendo has already sold more than 55 million of units worldwide<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">¹</a>. Lately, the COVID-19 situation boosted the sales as a lot of people under lockdown were looking for new sources of entertainment<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229666/nintendo-switch-march-npd-sales-playstation-4-xbox-one-animal-crossing">²</a></p>

<p>The success recipe of this platform is simple: the handheld and dock modes give versatility on how and where you can play; great first party games from well know franchise serving as a system seller (<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Splatoon 2</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</em>, <em>Mario Odyssey</em>, etc…) but also a lot of great interdependent game that were already successful on the PC (<em>Stardew Valley</em>, <em>Shovel Knight</em>, <em>Hollow Knight</em> or <em>Cuphead</em>) and the addition of a cheaper <em>“Lite”</em> model in Sept. 2019.</p>

<p>However I would like to focus on a specific category of game released on the Switch. At its release in 2017 one of the major critic was its lacks of new IPs and games<a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/nintendo-switch-third-party-games-support-2017-2">³</a>. or that only ports of Wii U games were announced (e.g. <em>BOTW</em>; <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>). Instead of following this argument, I would argue on the contrary that the Switch makes the perfect porting system for last gen system and even older titles. To make my point we will first discuss what are the requirements for porting a game to a system. Then let’s have a look at some port that were well executed as well as poorly ported ones. And meanwhile, why don’t we imagine what the Switch as yet to offer on the nostalgia road.</p>
