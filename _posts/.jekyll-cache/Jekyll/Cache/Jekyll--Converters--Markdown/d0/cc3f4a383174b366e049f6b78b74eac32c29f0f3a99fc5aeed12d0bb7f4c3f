<p>So, some interesting things came out in the past few days.</p>

<p>I think that one of the most hyped event of this week was the <strong>XBOX Series X Event</strong>. Unfortunately the reception was not as good as expected with one major complaint being the <em>Gameplay</em> reveal event was nothing more that long scripted cinematics.</p>

<p>And there  is no denying it when the first video they show us, entitled <em>First Look Xbox Series X Gamplay</em> (why make it so longâ€¦), is the trailer for <strong>Bright Memory Infinite</strong> from the dev. at FYQD-Studio. Sure, it looks like gameplay, but the lack of UI, the heavily scripted actions and the cinematic car chase at the end are not the best you can do to truly make the viewer believe in it. And it goes on like that for the rest of the presentation with little actual gameplay and more game footage.</p>

<p>The backlash was vocal enough that Aaron Greenberg (GM of Xbox Game Marketing) acknowledge the issue in a tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Had we not said anything &amp; just shown May Inside Xbox show like we did last month, I suspect reactions might have been different. Clearly we set some wrong expectations &amp; thatâ€™s on us. We appreciate all the feedback &amp; can assure you we will take it all in &amp; learn as a team. ğŸ™ğŸ»ğŸ’š</p>&mdash; Aaron Greenberg ğŸ™…ğŸ¼â€â™‚ï¸â (@aarongreenberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1258584474155053058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Of course the info that made the news on the 6th of May is the ESRB rating for Cyberpunk 2077. The surprise didnâ€™t come from the rating itself as it was obvious that a M rating was expected knowing the themes and content of the game. What made people go nut and started a new load of memes is this statement in the rating:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">The game contains nudity and sexual material: Players can select a gender and customize their character; customization can include depictions of breasts, buttocks, and genitalia, as well as various sizes and combinations of genitals. Players can encounter events where they have the option to engage in sexual activities with other main characters or prostitutesâ€”these brief sex scenes (from a first-person perspective) depict partially nude characters moaning suggestively while moving through various positions. Some scenes contain brief depictions of thrusting motions; other scenes depict a character's head moving towards a partner's crotch.</code></p>
